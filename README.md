ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I go by @CoderGren on GitHub, but you can refer to me as Gren. 
That's short for Grenjamin! Haha, just kidding of course. Could you imagine?!
Real talk though Iâ€™m aiming to use my gifts to push the limits of technology.
At any given moment, you can find me either improving my fundamentals or pushing my latest tech improvements to the internet.
If you're interested in collaborating, learning, or just want to 'shoot-the-sheet' as I say,
you can reach out to me at "glen@unsuccessfultech.com" my work email.
